Good news! The error shows that Microsoft/Azure OAuth is being triggered - you can see it's trying to load from aadcdn.msftauth.net (Microsoft's authentication domain). The 404 error is because it's trying to call a /l endpoint on your Codespace URL, which means the redirect flow got confused.

The issue is that Supabase's OAuth flow needs to be configured correctly in Supabase's dashboard. You need to make sure:

In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Microsoft/Azure:

Enable the provider
Add your Redirect URL: https://rfhitxqaihbqmiakbnxa.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
Verify your OAuth redirect URL is set in Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration:

Site URL: https://rfhitxqaihbqmiakbnxa.supabase.co
Redirect URLs: https://rfhitxqaihbqmiakbnxa.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
The OAuth flow is working now - it's just a matter of Supabase being configured correctly to handle the Microsoft callback. Check your Supabase dashboard to ensure those settings are in place.
